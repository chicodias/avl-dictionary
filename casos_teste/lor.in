dangerous cried gandalf and so am i very dangerous more dangerous than anything you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before the seat of the dark lord and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous you are beset with dangers gimli son of gl贸in for you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion certainly the forest of fangorn is perilousnot least to those that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself he is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless but now his long slow wrath is brimming over and all the forest is filled with it the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it it will soon be running like a flood but its tide is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard a thing is about to happen which has not happened since the elder days the ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong

yes together we will follow you said legolas but first it would ease my heart gandalf to hear what befell you in moria will you not tell us can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered i have stayed already too long answered gandalf time is short but if there were a year to spend i would not tell you all then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli come gandalf tell us how you fared with the balrog name him not said gandalf and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face and he sat silent looking old as death long time i fell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with difficulty long i fell and he fell with me his fire was about me i was burned then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my heart deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins bridge and none has measured it said gimli yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf thither i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone he was with me still his fire was quenched but now he was a thing of slime stronger than a strangling snake we fought far under the living earth where time is not counted ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him till at last he fled into dark tunnels they were not made by durins folk gimli son of gl贸in far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves the world is gnawed by nameless things even sauron knows them not they are older than he now i have walked there but i will bring no report to darken the light of day in that despair my enemy was my only hope and i pursued him clutching at his heel thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of khazadd没m too well he knew them all ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair long has that been lost said gimli many have said that it was never made save in legend but others say that it was destroyed it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it issued at last in durins tower carved in the living rock of zirakzigil the pinnacle of the silvertine there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped in cloud out he sprang and even as i came behind he burst into new flame there was none to see or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak suddenly gandalf laughed but what would they say in song those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon celebdil and leaped back broken into tongues of fire is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam ice fell like rain i threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the mountainside where he smote it in his ruin then darkness took me and i strayed out of thought and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell naked i was sent back for a brief time until my task is done and naked i lay upon the mountaintop the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone i was alone forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world there i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over and each day was as long as a lifeage of the earth faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands the springing and the dying the song and the weeping and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me again and he took me up and bore me away ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said a burden you have been he answered but not so now light as a swans feather in my claw you are the sun shines through you indeed i do not think you need me any more were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind do not let me fall i gasped for i felt life in me again bear me to lothl贸rien that indeed is the command of the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
